Sure, let's dive into an overview, advantages, disadvantages, creation process, and differences between AWS EC2, Azure Virtual Machines, and Google Compute Engine.

### 1. AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

**Overview:**
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.

**Advantages:**
- **Scalability:** Auto-scaling and load balancing features allow for scaling up or down based on demand.
- **Flexibility:** Wide range of instance types, storage options, and configurations.
- **Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with other AWS services like S3, RDS, and Lambda.
- **Global Reach:** Available in multiple regions and availability zones.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Complexity:** Can be overwhelming due to the vast array of services and options.
- **Cost:** Costs can add up quickly without proper management and monitoring.
- **Vendor Lock-in:** Relying heavily on AWS-specific services can make migration to other providers challenging.

**Creation Process:**
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Open the EC2 Dashboard.
3. Click "Launch Instance".
4. Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
5. Select an instance type.
6. Configure instance details, such as network settings and IAM roles.
7. Add storage and tags.
8. Configure security groups (firewall settings).
9. Review and launch the instance.

### 2. Azure Virtual Machines
