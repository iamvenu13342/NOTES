**Creation Process:**
1. Sign in to the Google Cloud Console.
2. Navigate to the "AI Platform" section.
3. Create an AI Platform Notebook for development.
4. Configure the notebook environment (instance type, framework, etc.).
5. Use the notebook to develop and train your ML model.
6. Submit a training job via the AI Platform for large-scale training.
7. Deploy the trained model to an endpoint for serving predictions.
