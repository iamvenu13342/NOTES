The term "strangler" pattern typically refers to a design or architectural pattern in software development where a new version of a software component is introduced alongside the existing version. The new version gradually takes over the functionality of the old version, "strangling" it as it becomes more capable and the old version becomes obsolete.

In the context of deployment or migration strategies, this pattern allows for a smooth transition from an old system to a new one without disrupting existing operations. It's often used when a complete overhaul of a system is not feasible or practical, allowing for incremental updates and improvements over time.
