<h1> Policy as Code in Ansible</h1>

#### Understanding Policy as Code

**Policy as Code** is the practice of defining and managing policies through code rather than through manual processes. This approach allows policies to be version-controlled, tested, and automated in the same way as application code. In the context of Ansible, Policy as Code helps ensure that infrastructure and operational policies are consistently enforced across environments.

**Key Benefits of Policy as Code:**
- **Consistency:** Ensures that policies are applied uniformly across all environments.
- **Auditability:** Policies defined as code can be easily reviewed and audited.
- **Automation:** Enables automated enforcement and compliance checks.
- **Version Control:** Policies can be managed and tracked through version control systems.

#### Implementing Policy as Code in Ansible

Ansible allows you to implement Policy as Code by defining policies in playbooks, roles, and custom modules. These policies can enforce security configurations, compliance requirements, and operational best practices.

**Example Use Cases:**
- Ensuring all servers have specific security settings.
- Verifying compliance with regulatory standards (e.g., CIS benchmarks).
- Automating routine checks for configuration drift.

#### Defining Policies in Ansible Playbooks

**Example: Enforcing a Security Policy**

This example playbook ensures that password authentication is disabled for SSH on all servers.

```yaml
---
- name: Enforce SSH security policies
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Disable password authentication for SSH
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        regexp: '^#?PasswordAuthentication'
        line: 'PasswordAuthentication no'
        state: present
      notify: Restart sshd

  handlers:
    - name: Restart sshd
      service:
        name: sshd
        state: restarted
```

**Example: Enforcing Compliance with CIS Benchmarks**

This example playbook ensures that the system is configured according to specific CIS (Center for Internet Security) benchmarks.

```yaml
---
- name: Enforce CIS benchmark policies
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure no unconfined daemons exist
      command: ps -eZ | egrep 'unconfined_service_t'
      register: ps_output
      failed_when: ps_output.rc == 0

    - name: Ensure audit log is configured
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/audit/auditd.conf
        regexp: '^log_file'
        line: 'log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log'
        state: present
```

#### Using Ansible Roles for Policy Enforcement

Roles can be used to group related policy tasks and make them reusable across multiple playbooks.

**Example: Role for Enforcing Security Policies**

Create a role named `security_policies` with the following structure:

```
security_policies/
├── tasks/
│   └── main.yml
├── handlers/
│   └── main.yml
└── defaults/
    └── main.yml
```

**tasks/main.yml:**

```yaml
---
- name: Ensure SSH password authentication is disabled
  lineinfile:
    path: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    regexp: '^#?PasswordAuthentication'
    line: 'PasswordAuthentication no'
    state: present
  notify: Restart sshd

- name: Ensure audit log is configured
  lineinfile:
    path: /etc/audit/auditd.conf
    regexp: '^log_file'
    line: 'log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log'
    state: present
```

**handlers/main.yml:**

```yaml
---
- name: Restart sshd
  service:
    name: sshd
    state: restarted
```

**defaults/main.yml:**

```yaml
---
# Default variables for the role
```

**Including the Role in a Playbook:**

```yaml
---
- name: Apply security policies
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  roles:
    - security_policies
```

#### Custom Ansible Modules for Policy Enforcement

In some cases, you may need to create custom modules to enforce specific policies that are not covered by existing Ansible modules.

**Example: Custom Module to Check for Unconfined Daemons**

Create a custom module named `check_unconfined_daemons.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

from ansible.module_utils.basic import AnsibleModule

def main():
    module = AnsibleModule(
        argument_spec=dict()
    )

    ps_output = module.run_command("ps -eZ | egrep 'unconfined_service_t'")[1]

    if ps_output:
        module.fail_json(msg="Unconfined daemons exist: {}".format(ps_output))
    else:
        module.exit_json(msg="No unconfined daemons found.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Use the custom module in a playbook:

```yaml
---
- name: Check for unconfined daemons
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Run custom module to check for unconfined daemons
      check_unconfined_daemons:
```

#### Best Practices for Policy as Code

**1. Modularize Policies:**
Organize policies into modular roles and playbooks to promote reusability and maintainability.

**2. Use Version Control:**
Store policy definitions in a version control system to track changes and maintain a history of policy enforcement.

**3. Test Policies:**
Regularly test policies using Ansible playbooks in a staging environment before applying them to production systems.

**4. Automate Policy Enforcement:**
Integrate policy enforcement playbooks into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure that policies are consistently applied.

**5. Document Policies:**
Maintain clear documentation of all policies defined in code to ensure that team members understand the intent and implementation of each policy.

**6. Regularly Review and Update Policies:**
Continuously review and update policies to adapt to new security threats, compliance requirements, and operational best practices.

By adopting Policy as Code in Ansible, you can ensure that your infrastructure and operations are consistently managed according to predefined policies, leading to improved security, compliance, and operational efficiency.
