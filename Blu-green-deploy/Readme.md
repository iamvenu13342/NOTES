Blue-Green Deployment is a software release technique that minimizes downtime and risk by running two identical production environments, termed "Blue" and "Green." At any time, only one of these environments serves live production traffic. When deploying a new version of the application, it is deployed to the idle environment (e.g., Green). Once the new version is verified to be functioning correctly, traffic is switched over from the active environment (e.g., Blue) to the updated one (Green). This method allows for a seamless transition with minimal impact on users and an easy rollback if necessary.
