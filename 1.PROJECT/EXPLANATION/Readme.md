Deploying an e-commerce application on AWS typically involves using a variety of AWS services to ensure scalability, security, availability, and performance. Hereâ€™s a detailed list of commonly used AWS services for deploying an e-commerce application, along with their roles:

### Core Services

1. **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**
   - **Purpose**: Provides resizable compute capacity for running application servers.
   - **Use Case**: Hosting the web servers, application servers, and background processing services.

2. **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**
   - **Purpose**: Managed relational database service.
   - **Use Case**: Storing transactional data, user data, and product catalogs.

3. **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**
   - **Purpose**: Scalable object storage service.
   - **Use Case**: Storing static assets like images, videos, backups, and log files.

4. **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**
   - **Purpose**: Managed Kubernetes service.
   - **Use Case**: Orchestrating containerized applications, ensuring easy deployment and scaling.

### Networking and Security

5. **Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**
   - **Purpose**: Isolated network for your AWS resources.
   - **Use Case**: Providing network isolation and segmentation for different parts of the application.

6. **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)**
   - **Purpose**: Manage user access and encryption keys.
   - **Use Case**: Controlling access to AWS services and resources securely.

7. **AWS Security Groups**
   - **Purpose**: Acts as a virtual firewall to control inbound and outbound traffic.
   - **Use Case**: Restricting access to EC2 instances, RDS databases, and other resources.

8. **Amazon CloudFront**
   - **Purpose**: Content Delivery Network (CDN).
   - **Use Case**: Distributing static and dynamic web content to users with low latency.

### Storage and Databases

9. **Amazon DynamoDB**
   - **Purpose**: NoSQL database service.
   - **Use Case**: Handling high-velocity data like session storage, product recommendations, and shopping cart data.

10. **Amazon ElastiCache**
    - **Purpose**: In-memory caching service.
    - **Use Case**: Improving application performance by caching frequently accessed data.

### Monitoring and Logging

11. **Amazon CloudWatch**
    - **Purpose**: Monitoring and observability service.
    - **Use Case**: Monitoring application performance, setting alarms, and logging.

12. **AWS CloudTrail**
    - **Purpose**: Tracking user activity and API usage.
    - **Use Case**: Auditing changes and ensuring security compliance.

### Deployment and Automation

13. **AWS CodePipeline**
    - **Purpose**: Continuous integration and continuous delivery service.
    - **Use Case**: Automating the build, test, and deployment phases of application development.

14. **AWS CodeBuild**
    - **Purpose**: Managed build service.
    - **Use Case**: Compiling source code, running tests, and producing software packages.

15. **AWS CodeDeploy**
    - **Purpose**: Automates application deployments to various compute services.
    - **Use Case**: Deploying code to EC2 instances, Lambda functions, or ECS services.

16. **AWS Lambda**
    - **Purpose**: Serverless compute service.
    - **Use Case**: Running event-driven functions, processing data streams, or performing background tasks.

### Additional Services

17. **Amazon Route 53**
    - **Purpose**: Scalable Domain Name System (DNS) service.
    - **Use Case**: Managing DNS entries, routing user requests to application endpoints.

18. **AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)**
    - **Purpose**: Protecting web applications from common web exploits.
    - **Use Case**: Enhancing security by filtering and monitoring HTTP requests.

19. **AWS Secrets Manager**
    - **Purpose**: Managing and retrieving secrets securely.
    - **Use Case**: Storing database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information.

20. **AWS Certificate Manager**
    - **Purpose**: Provisioning, managing, and deploying SSL/TLS certificates.
    - **Use Case**: Enabling HTTPS on web applications to ensure secure communication.

### Example Architecture

1. **Frontend**:
   - **Amazon S3 + CloudFront**: Host static assets like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.
   - **Amazon Route 53**: DNS routing.

2. **Backend**:
   - **Amazon EC2 or EKS**: Running backend application servers.
   - **AWS Lambda**: Running serverless functions for certain application logic.

3. **Database Layer**:
   - **Amazon RDS**: Primary relational database.
   - **Amazon DynamoDB**: For high-performance NoSQL data needs.
   - **Amazon ElastiCache**: Caching layer to improve read performance.

4. **Networking and Security**:
   - **Amazon VPC**: Isolated network environment.
   - **AWS IAM**: Secure access control.
   - **AWS Security Groups**: Firewall configurations.

5. **Monitoring and Management**:
   - **Amazon CloudWatch**: Application monitoring and logging.
   - **AWS CloudTrail**: User activity and API usage tracking.

6. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - **AWS CodePipeline + CodeBuild + CodeDeploy**: Continuous integration and deployment.

This combination of AWS services creates a robust, scalable, and secure environment for deploying and managing an e-commerce application.
