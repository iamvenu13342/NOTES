<h1> Getting Started with Terraform</h1>

### Introduction to Terraform and IaC

**Terraform** is a powerful tool for managing infrastructure as code (IaC). IaC is the practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable scripts, rather than through physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. Terraform allows you to define your infrastructure in a high-level configuration language, which is then used to generate an execution plan that creates or updates your infrastructure to match the desired state.

#### Why Terraform and IaC?
- **Consistency and Repeatability**: Terraform ensures that infrastructure can be recreated consistently across different environments.
- **Version Control**: Infrastructure configurations can be versioned, allowing you to track changes and collaborate with others.
- **Automation**: By scripting your infrastructure, you reduce the risk of human error and automate the provisioning process.
- **Scalability**: Easily manage complex environments and scale resources up or down as needed.

### Installing Terraform

**For MacOS, Linux, and Windows**, follow these steps to install Terraform:

#### MacOS

2. **Extract the zip file**.
3. **Add the binary to your PATH**:
   - Open System Properties > Advanced > Environment Variables.
   - Under "System Variables", find the `Path` variable and click "Edit".
   - Add the path to the folder where you extracted the Terraform binary.
4. **Verify Installation**:
   ```sh
   terraform -v
   ```

### Setting up Terraform for AWS

To use Terraform with AWS, you need to set up your AWS credentials and configure the AWS provider in your Terraform configuration.

#### AWS Credentials
1. **Install the AWS CLI**:
   - Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html).
2. **Configure the AWS CLI**:
   ```sh
   aws configure
   ```
   - Enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, region, and output format.

#### Configure AWS Provider
In your Terraform configuration file (e.g., `main.tf`), add the following:
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}
```

### Writing Your First Terraform Code

Let's start with a simple example: provisioning an AWS S3 bucket.

1. **Create a new directory** for your Terraform project:
   ```sh
   mkdir my-terraform-project
   cd my-terraform-project
   ```
2. **Create a new file** named `main.tf`:
   ```hcl
   provider "aws" {
     region = "us-west-2"
   }

   resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
     bucket = "my-unique-bucket-name-12345"
     acl    = "private"
   }
   ```
3. **Initialize the Terraform configuration**:
   ```sh
   terraform init
   ```
4. **Validate the configuration**:
   ```sh
   terraform validate
   ```
5. **Create an execution plan**:
   ```sh
   terraform plan
   ```
6. **Apply the configuration** to provision the resources:
   ```sh
   terraform apply
   ```
   - Type `yes` to confirm the apply action.

     ## Terraform Lifecycle

Terraform operates through a series of stages to manage and deploy infrastructure. Understanding the lifecycle stages—`init`, `plan`, and `apply`—is crucial for using Terraform effectively.

### Terraform Lifecycle Stages

1. **terraform init**
   - **Purpose**: Initializes a new or existing Terraform configuration.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Downloads and installs the necessary provider plugins specified in your configuration.
     - Prepares the working directory for other Terraform commands.
   - **Example**:
     ```sh
     terraform init
     ```

2. **terraform plan**
   - **Purpose**: Creates an execution plan.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Analyzes the Terraform configuration and the current state of the infrastructure.
     - Determines what actions are required to reach the desired state.
     - Shows a preview of the changes that will be made.
   - **Example**:
     ```sh
     terraform plan
     ```

3. **terraform apply**
   - **Purpose**: Applies the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Executes the actions proposed by the `terraform plan` command.
     - Modifies the infrastructure to match the configuration.
   - **Example**:
     ```sh
     terraform apply
     ```
     - Type `yes` to confirm the apply action.

## Launching an EC2 Instance

Provisioning an EC2 instance is a common task when managing AWS infrastructure. Here’s how you can launch an EC2 instance using Terraform.

### Steps to Launch an EC2 Instance

1. **Create a new directory** for your EC2 instance project:
   ```sh
   mkdir ec2-terraform
   cd ec2-terraform
   ```

2. **Create a Terraform configuration file** named `main.tf`:
   ```hcl
   provider "aws" {
     region = "us-west-2"
   }

   resource "aws_instance" "example" {
     ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"  # Example AMI ID, replace with a valid one
     instance_type = "t2.micro"
     tags = {
       Name = "TerraformExampleInstance"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Initialize Terraform**:
   ```sh
   terraform init
   ```

4. **Create an execution plan**:
   ```sh
   terraform plan
   ```

5. **Apply the configuration** to launch the EC2 instance:
   ```sh
   terraform apply
   ```
   - Type `yes` to confirm the apply action.

### Customizing the Instance
- **Instance Type**: Define the type of instance (e.g., `t2.micro`, `m5.large`).
- **AMI (Amazon Machine Image)**: Specify the AMI ID to use for the instance.
- **Tags**: Add tags to identify and categorize your instance.

## Terraform State Basics

Terraform uses state files to manage the infrastructure it creates and maintains. Understanding Terraform state is critical for ensuring infrastructure consistency.

### What is Terraform State?

- **State File**: A JSON file that Terraform uses to map real-world resources to your configuration.
- **Current State**: Reflects the actual resources deployed in your environment.
- **Desired State**: The configuration you define in your Terraform files.

### Importance of Terraform State

- **Resource Mapping**: Keeps track of resource attributes and dependencies.
- **Change Tracking**: Detects changes between your configuration and the real-world infrastructure.
- **Collaboration**: Facilitates collaboration by enabling team members to share and manage infrastructure consistently.

### Managing Terraform State

1. **Initialization**: During `terraform init`, Terraform sets up the state file in the working directory.
2. **Updates**: When you run `terraform apply`, the state file is updated to reflect the current infrastructure.
3. **Storage**:
   - **Local**: By default, the state file (`terraform.tfstate`) is stored locally.
   - **Remote**: For collaboration, you can store state files remotely using backends like AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or HashiCorp Consul.

### Commands

- **terraform state list**: Lists all resources in the state file.
- **terraform state show [RESOURCE]**: Shows attributes of a specific resource.
- **terraform state rm [RESOURCE]**: Removes a resource from the state file (use with caution).

### Example of Remote State Configuration
```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "my-terraform-state"
    key    = "path/to/my/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-west-2"
  }
}
```
